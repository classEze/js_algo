we have also created an account on sonar cloud and created a project.

Now he bought a domain on godaddy before, he then went ahead to generate/request a certificate on ACM and then copy the CNAME records
 of that certificate over to godaddy domain manager. I will have to do this later

 Section 2 - Prerequisites done June 12th 2023. Progress surely

 SECTION 3
 VM Machine
 Problem with Spinning up servers before VM technology -
 Servers were always overprovisioned - 20Gig ram would be provisioned for a 10Gig RAM database
 One service one server
 It was a big deal to run an IT project eg 15 - 10 servers for one project.

 There came VMWARE which enabled us to run many OS to run 0n one physical machines
 There is network virtualization, storage virtualization etc
 Hypervisor, a software allows you to create a virtual machine haviing its own OS on which you can run your apps.
 SNAPSHOT - A backup of a guest machine

 Hypervisor types - 
        Type 1 - Bare metal - runs as a base OS, only used on production eg microsoft Hyper V
        Type 2 - for testing and learning eg oracle vm. virtual box

**If you want to automate anything, first learn to do it manually

He downloaded server Os and not desktop OS first
VAGRANT - AN automation tool to manage your VM life cycle
Vagrant is not graphical, it is a command line tool, it is simply used to automate spinning up a vm by just editing the vagrant file

Vagrant commands i ran include 
vagrant init centos/7 - to create vagrant file with the image configurations from vagrant cloud
vagrant up - to download box image from vagrant cloud to your laptop if not exist AND run the box image to bring up the vm
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy --force


Virtual box is not supported on Mac M1 Chip
Fedora similar to centos

MAC VMWare fusion, vagrant plugin
