STYLED ComponentsA way to write ordinary css inside react using javascript string literal

e.g
const Container = styled.div(`
  width:1000px;
  color:blue;
  background-color:yellow;
  height:${(props)=> props.height};
  &:hover{

  };
  h2{
    color:black
  }
`

)

So you can wrap ypur whole app with a theme provider component imported from styled-components. You then give this a theme prop which could be an object having several nested objects for key values which you can destructure within your styled component styling and use

You can use {createGlobalStyles} to create a block of css styles and resets , then import it and render within your top level app component

You can import fonts within your createGlobalStyles`
@import url("https://blah-blah")

p{
    padding:0;
    margin:0
}
`

so styled components means no classes right ?? yeah, and means your styles for a particular component are all enclosed in one place, easy to debug and modify
