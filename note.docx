COMMON SENSE GUIDE

However, we do know that there’s a specific range in which O(N * M) lies. That
is, if N and M are the same, it’s equivalent to O(N2). And if they’re not the
same, and we arbitrarily assign the smaller number to be M, even if M is as
low as 1, we end up with O(N). In a sense then, O(N * M) can be construed
as a range between O(N) and O(N2).

Password generator might use an algorithm of O(26)n – Each time we add one element od data, the algorithm doubles in steps

One  area in which
recursion shines is where we need to act on a problem that has an arbitrary
number of levels of depth. A second area in which recursion shines is where
it is able to make a calculation based on a subproblem of the problem at hand

computer science literature
refers to the terms bottom up and top down in regard to recursion strategies.

This brings us to the central point of this chapter: recursion shines when
implementing a top-down approach because going top down offers a new
mental strategy for tackling a problem. That is, a recursive top-down approach
allows one to think about a problem in a completely different way

Specifically, when we go top down, we get to mentally “kick the problem down
the road.” We can free our mind from some of the nitty-gritty details we normally
have to think about when going bottom up.
