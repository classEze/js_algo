COMMON SENSE GUIDE

However, we do know that there’s a specific range in which O(N * M) lies. That
is, if N and M are the same, it’s equivalent to O(N2). And if they’re not the
same, and we arbitrarily assign the smaller number to be M, even if M is as
low as 1, we end up with O(N). In a sense then, O(N * M) can be construed
as a range between O(N) and O(N2).

Password generator might use an algorithm of O(26)n – Each time we add one element od data, the algorithm doubles in steps

One  area in which
recursion shines is where we need to act on a problem that has an arbitrary
number of levels of depth. A second area in which recursion shines is where
it is able to make a calculation based on a subproblem of the problem at hand
